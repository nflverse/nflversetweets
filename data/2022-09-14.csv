While working on it I realized I could create robust geoms and theme elements that have nothing to do with nfl football. These fit better in a new, separate package. Thatâ€™s ggpath."

These numbers are listed in LB, DL, DB order, so a 2-4-5 formation would be 2 LB, 4, DL, and 5 DB's on the field. For as little variation the Rams had on offense, they showed a ton more on defense.
