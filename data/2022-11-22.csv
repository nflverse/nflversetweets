✈️ One of the best rushing attacks in franchise history before the Hall injury.
✈️ Great passing personnel held to **2020 Gase/Darnold numbers** by the young QB.
✈️ A top-3 defense.

Total EPA vs Total Rushing EPA

Daniel Jones:
Total EPA = 49.6 (10th)
Total Rushing EPA = 25.7 (4th)

More than half of Jones’ EPA comes from rushing!

If you subtract out EPA from all QB runs, Jones would rank 14th in EPA/play

• Tua has the highest overall EPA/play despite a negative EPA/play on QB rushes

• Fields (and Kyler and Russ) have a +EPA/play bc of their QB Rushes

Jet is still getting the majority of the 11 personnel RB snaps. Watson is clearly the JuJu replacement. Moore with a season high % of everything.

NOTE: Dunlap is officially listed as a LB. Blame KC and NFL for that.

Up &amp; right are players who are better against the run and play in run-heavy situations, down &amp; left is the opposite.
