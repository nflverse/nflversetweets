✈️ One of the best rushing attacks in franchise history before the Hall injury.
✈️ Great passing personnel held to **2020 Gase/Darnold numbers** by the young QB.
✈️ A top-3 defense.

Total EPA vs Total Rushing EPA

Daniel Jones:
Total EPA = 49.6 (10th)
Total Rushing EPA = 25.7 (4th)

More than half of Jones’ EPA comes from rushing!

If you subtract out EPA from all QB runs, Jones would rank 14th in EPA/play
