I remember seeing a shiny app that allowed you to filter NFLreadR data based on all sorts of fields.
Does anyone happen to know what app this was?"

The sample size for some teams, e.g. the losing side of the Eagles or the winning side of the Texans, is quite small. But still some nice insights.

Notes: No * = throwaway, sack, or no play (penalty). QB scramble is classified as a pass, while a designed QB run is a rush. See Perkins on LA chart below.
