Watson with his customary #2 WR snaps and 1 catch, for #reasons. 8 touches for Toney, which is more than the rest of the WR group put together.

Cook got run at the end of the half and end of game. Chenal got a handful of snaps. Harris got half a drive from Gay. Dunlap didn't get many snaps at all.

Jamal Agnew barely played until the drive where he fumbled, where he was in on all but the first play. LB C.Muma is maybe their version of our Harris? He got one drive, and that's it.
