As always, I welcome questions and comments

This viz is still a work in progress, but thought I'd share an update following some additions.

Chiefs still being blitzed less often than average, and finding success vs them. SF has had incredible success vs the blitz on first downs. 11 personnel is both teams money formation against the blitz.
