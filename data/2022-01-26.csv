Do these offenses play differently when these scripts are used? I used @nflfastR to explore this.

Ja'Marr Chase torched the Chiefs in Week 17 (11/266/3!), so I think KC tries to ""Belichick"" him and focuses on shutting him out.

If this happens, I think Higgins, who excelled when Chase struggled, becomes the go-to for Cincy.
