Jet is still getting the majority of the 11 personnel RB snaps. Watson is clearly the JuJu replacement. Moore with a season high % of everything.

NOTE: Dunlap is officially listed as a LB. Blame KC and NFL for that.

Overall, though, our D held them to 0.14 EPA/play, which is solid vs a good O. On defense, they got absolutely COOKED in their top two formations.
