We were in base a lot, so didn't have a third CB on the field for those snaps. Williams played over Watson, though, when a 3rd CB was required. Wonder if that split will be matchup dependent.

NOTE!! 

Dunlap's snaps are under LB here. I'm sorry about that, but it's his official designation, and how NGS (where we get this data from) categorizes his snaps.

Toney got 8 of 9 snaps on 1st or 2nd downs. Pacheco started again, then McKinnon took over. Skyy stayed involved the entire game, as did Justin Watson.
