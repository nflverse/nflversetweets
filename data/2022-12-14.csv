I thought the EPA/Play variability chart from 2021 was cool so I decided to look at it for the season so far. It's really impressive how consistently mediocre the Falcons offense has been this season.

Not the best day by EPA/play for KC. 11 and 12 personnel were solid. Pop gets more run in 12 personnel than 11. Seeing Moore get snaps outside of 3 WR sets is nice.

Dunlap is listed as LB, which actually gets us fun on/off splits with him. D was significantly better with him on the field this week.
