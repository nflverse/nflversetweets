🏈 Tom Brady comes to play on Turkey Day
🏈 Mark Sanchez obviously remains an NFL Thanksgiving icon

After running this week's simulations and seeing that - checks notes - the @steelers were estimated to be the 3rd best team in the nation, I knew something was amiss.  #nflverse https://t.co/2zq0HRlbTr"

I am deeply sorry if I have misled you :( #nflverse"
