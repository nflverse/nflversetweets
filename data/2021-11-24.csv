üèà No surprise to see Jason Witten on the list (16 games!)
üèà Tom Brady comes to play on Turkey Day
üèà Mark Sanchez obviously remains an NFL Thanksgiving icon

After running this week's simulations and seeing that - checks notes - the @steelers were estimated to be the 3rd best team in the nation, I knew something was amiss.  #nflverse https://t.co/2zq0HRlbTr"
"Wed Nov 24 22:20:18 +0000 2021","29360193","davisj2007","1463633603515097095","So I went digging through my code, and low and behold, a single instance in which I called ""predict"" on a gamlss object, but used ""new_data"" instead of ""newdata"", meaning that the simulation was looping through training data predictions #nflverse"
"Wed Nov 24 22:20:19 +0000 2021","29360193","davisj2007","1463633605079539715","This, of course, was not ideal, and while its issue was mitigated by the other parts of the algorithm, it obviously was causing incorrect outcomes, and therefore, poor estimates of strength and game-by-game predictions.  I am deeply sorry if I have misled you :( #nflverse"
"Wed Nov 24 22:20:20 +0000 2021","29360193","davisj2007","1463633610335043587","Code is fixed now, and the model hasn't changed from the original design (I think I know when I made this mistake, which was during some cleanup around Week 6, but don't know for sure).  Either way, here are the models predictions for the rest of the year #nflverse https://t.co/3xsP4AmzMx"
"Wed Nov 24 22:20:22 +0000 2021","29360193","davisj2007","1463633617289191433","And this week's games - which I hope will improve my standing in @FiveThirtyEight and @LeeSharpeNFL prediction game #nflverse https://t.co/Sq6TLExfGG"
"Wed Nov 24 22:20:23 +0000 2021","29360193","davisj2007","1463633623995850752","And here are estimates of ""true"" team strength, which seems far more in line with my own thinking than some of the bolder claims happening earlier in the year (which I attributed to some latent strength observed in the data, which was likely more just code error) #nflverse https://t.co/0iJGv3jlKm"
"Wed Nov 24 22:20:24 +0000 2021","29360193","davisj2007","1463633626420162562","I'll eventually go back and perform some retrodiction on a week by week basis to reproduce the trend charts, but that's for another day after I finish eating away my code error sorrows tomorrow - happy Thanksgiving y'all, and sorry again! #nflverse"
