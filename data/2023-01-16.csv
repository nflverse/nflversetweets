Unsurprisingly, home teams are responsible for the biggest blowouts

The largest one in the last 23 yrs was in 2009 when the Pats beat the Titans 59-0

(6) BAL @ (3) CIN
(5) LAC @ (4) JAX

(1) KC (bye)

KC starters needed to come out a couple drives before they did. Is Andy trying to make playoff opponents forget about JuJu? Toney's killing it in a limited role.

Harris took his traditional 3rd drive of the game from Gay. DL Williams still getting solid run. Oddly, Chenal didn't get any snaps in garbage time. I know passing downs aren't his role, but still.

Nate Hobbs either got injured or was replaced. It's not like they've got good DB's, so probs an injury. Hope he's alright. I didn't get to see the game.
