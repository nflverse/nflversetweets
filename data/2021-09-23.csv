Not all of us are jerks, and rooting for an injury/calling out injured players on social media is classless. Get well @RMos_8Ball  #nflverse #NFL"

Not last night. A lot of runs to the left guard and right tackle, but they weren't very effective. #nflverse https://t.co/JXuSU8gYfs"

Next up, a Chiefs team that lives and dies by the big play, coming off a dramatic comeback... #nflverse https://t.co/l37pgu6uwV"

Baltimore had the 6th lowest average time remaining on the play clock at the snap in 2020 at 8.8 secs and the 5th lowest in Week 1 at 7.2 secs. #nflverse https://t.co/FwIg35mTkl"
