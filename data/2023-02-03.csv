No place I know has the play by play for every down with EPA. But yes, the pbp does also have win probability added. I can check when I get back on my computer."

Successful in every way. Also, boy isn't it nice when JuJu gets to play the whole game, and Toney gets his touches??

He is now in his rightful place as a DL, and all numbers now account for that switch. Jax got us when we had 6 DB's on the field. Probably garbage time up 10 stats.

Our offense beat every defensive formation they had like a drum except for their 1-5-5, whatever the hell THAT is. 6 snaps in that formation, and it worked!
