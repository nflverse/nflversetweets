Zach Wilson takes this offense from bad with Flacco to middle of the pack (or better if he improves).

Pacheco, the nominal starter, got the fewest snaps of the RB's, even with the three meaningless snaps to end the game. Hardman led WR's in snaps. Moores snaps dropped.

Gay sat out two entire drives, replaced by Harris first, then by Cook. Wow, after the Moore flub, Jones, Clark, and Karlaftis all sat that entire drive (ended in TD). ðŸ¤·
