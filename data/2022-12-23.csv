I thought the EPA/Play variability chart from 2021 was cool so I decided to look at it for the season so far. It's really impressive how consistently mediocre the Falcons offense has been this season.

The Chiefs win 63% of their games when Vegas pregame odds are set between a 41-60% chance of winning (expectation would be around the middle of that range, so ~50%). 

NOTE: Pregame odds only! Not in-game.

Not the best day by EPA/play for KC. 11 and 12 personnel were solid. Pop gets more run in 12 personnel than 11. Seeing Moore get snaps outside of 3 WR sets is nice.
