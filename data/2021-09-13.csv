• -12% pass rate over expected on 1st down relative to league play calls in same situations. -25% on 2nd down.
• Relative to 2020 McDaniels play calls in similar situations, he was more aggressive (+12% overall).

1) KC and Buffalo in the top 6 teams shows relying on top 2 doesn't inherently prevent a dynamic pass O
2) The Ravens will still want a more diverse passing attack in 2021
