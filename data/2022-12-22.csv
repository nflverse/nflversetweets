Toney only took snaps in 13p, meaning he was the only WR on the field. I find it interesting that we passed the LEAST in 11p, which is generally the passing formation.

I kinda like seeing his on/off splits though (splits are incredibly noisy. Please put NO EMPHASIS WHATSOEVER ON THEM!). Chenal only in for base D.

EPA/play does include penalties, btw. On defense, their five snaps in 3-3-5 were really good. Everything else was bad though.
