Check out his EPA/play stats game by game. From rookie sensation to Super Bowl LVII bound, this chart shows his remarkable consistency.

Tight ends first. Travis Kelce. He's the man. Gray with an uptick in snaps as well. Fortson took the normal amount of Fortson/Bell snaps.

Sure felt to me like Pacheco was out there most of the time. Pacheco was clearly hurting on some snaps, so I wonder if Jet had something wrong too, or if they just really liked Pacheco against Cincy.

Williams came back in against the team that essentially got him benched, and stepped up in a big way. All three rookies played exceptionally well. Not enough good things to say about them.

Cook with an uptick as well. Wonder if that was to help counteract Gay's injury, or just a normal part of the game plan?

Did he leave the game and not return, or did he come back in later? Normally my pillbox charts would tell me this... Harris with a slight uptick. Chenal barely got snaps.
