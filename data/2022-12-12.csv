Gay lost TWO series to Harris this week instead of just 1. Karlaftis snaps dropped significantly. Only Nnadi and Stallworth had fewer on the DLINE.

Chiefs offense first. Pacheco with only 5 snaps on the last 4 drives. Watson is maintaining his high snap counts, and I'm just not sure that means good things for Skyy Less-than-50%-snap-share-ever-even-with-WR-injuries. 🤷‍♂️

Williams lost 4 whole series to Watson, which is interesting, after Watson barely stepped onto the field for several weeks. Gay lost THREE series to Harris, instead of the traditional one (and a fourth to Cook). 🤷

Also, their two D.Jones on the DL messed up my code, because of course it did. So I made one of them a doctor. Congrats, Dre'Mont!

They subbed out their star QB (another f*cking D.Jones!! WTF!) and half their other starters, so clearly they had this game in hand. Congrats!

What's going on with Burford and Brunskill, idk. Denver did that weird swapping out of oline too. Sheesh! 5 runs to 37 passes in second half, not including the final series.
