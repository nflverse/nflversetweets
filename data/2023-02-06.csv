Probably due to all the attrition. But the other formations were pretty spectacular. Look at that 3TE 2WR set!!! Reid is a wizard.

Their defense did pretty good as well. Held Chiefs offense to well under their season average EPA/play. Hobbled Pat and WR injuries surely contributed as well.

No place I know has the play by play for every down with EPA. But yes, the pbp does also have win probability added. I can check when I get back on my computer."

Successful in every way. Also, boy isn't it nice when JuJu gets to play the whole game, and Toney gets his touches??

He is now in his rightful place as a DL, and all numbers now account for that switch. Jax got us when we had 6 DB's on the field. Probably garbage time up 10 stats.
