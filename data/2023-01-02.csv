Pacheco only had 1 third down snap. MVS led WR's snaps. JuJu I think was sacrificed to Surtain this week.

Gay *mostly* lost the 3rd drive to Harris, as usual. For being run stuffers, Williams and Nnadi were in for a lot of pass plays.

Chiefs FA acquisition in 2024 Jerry Jeudy (I'm manifesting this) had a nice game again. Lamar Jackson's name came up a lot in this game, probably because Surtain was ignored.
