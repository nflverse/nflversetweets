There is so much to see in this chart, I love it.

Some fun facts:
1. Detroit has lost 70% of their games
2. The Rams (LA or STL), Browns, and Jags haven't played on Thanksgiving

Jet is still getting the majority of the 11 personnel RB snaps. Watson is clearly the JuJu replacement. Moore with a season high % of everything.

NOTE: Dunlap is officially listed as a LB. Blame KC and NFL for that.

Overall, though, our D held them to 0.14 EPA/play, which is solid vs a good O. On defense, they got absolutely COOKED in their top two formations.
