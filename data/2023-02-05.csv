There is so much of this Mean Girls behavior from the more established football content creators it's ridiculous.

Tight ends first. Travis Kelce. He's the man. Gray with an uptick in snaps as well. Fortson took the normal amount of Fortson/Bell snaps.

Sure felt to me like Pacheco was out there most of the time. Pacheco was clearly hurting on some snaps, so I wonder if Jet had something wrong too, or if they just really liked Pacheco against Cincy.

Check out his EPA/play stats game by game. From rookie sensation to Super Bowl LVII bound, this chart shows his remarkable consistency.

KC offense vs CIN. 

We lost Toney on the second drive. Mecole and JuJu both injured on second drive of the third quarter. MVS took all but one snap after Hardman went out.

Gay left the game in the third, covered as usual by either Harris or Cook. Clark missed a handful of snaps to start the second, but then powered through basically the rest of the game. Mostly same for Jones.

Boyd went out middle of the second quarter. Looks like that was their only injury. Interestingly, they went 6 OL for a random 2nd and 1st down play late in the game.
