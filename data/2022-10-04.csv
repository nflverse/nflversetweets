McKinnon was in on a significant # of passing 3rd downs. Pacheco only got 1. Skyy got 11 pass and 11 run snaps. Fortson handled almost only pass plays until the game was out of hand.

Was replaced by Sean Murphy-Bunting, who got the INT at the end. Shaq Barrett...apparently played a game, I guess? Didn't see him 🤷‍♂️. NACHO WAS HERE!! Hi Nacho!!
