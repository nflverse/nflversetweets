Total EPA vs Total Rushing EPA

Daniel Jones:
Total EPA = 49.6 (10th)
Total Rushing EPA = 25.7 (4th)

More than half of Jonesâ€™ EPA comes from rushing!

If you subtract out EPA from all QB runs, Jones would rank 14th in EPA/play

Up &amp; right are players who are better against the run and play in run-heavy situations, down &amp; left is the opposite.
