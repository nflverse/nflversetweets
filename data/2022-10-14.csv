Both teams are pretty effective against the blitz. Buffalo gets blitzed a bit more often. I highly recommend not blitzing the Chiefs when they are in 3 WR sets.

Their 4th down numbers are skewed by a Carr to Adams TD thrown on a 4th and 1. Small sample size there. Bills are pretty effective with their blitzes, but don't blitz often.
