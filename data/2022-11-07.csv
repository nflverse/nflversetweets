Toney got 8 of 9 snaps on 1st or 2nd downs. Pacheco started again, then McKinnon took over. Skyy stayed involved the entire game, as did Justin Watson.

We were in base a lot, so didn't have a third CB on the field for those snaps. Williams played over Watson, though, when a 3rd CB was required. Wonder if that split will be matchup dependent.
