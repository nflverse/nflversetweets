MVS's snaps have fallen each week since his high of 82% in week 10. Moore is maintaining his 40-ish percent of snaps.

"Tue Dec 13 17:04:14 +0000 2022","3067061292","josephjefe","1602711004046979072","Defensive Ends. Karlaftis back over 60% of the snaps. Maybe they're trying to keep him in the 35-40 snaps per game range? That's basically where he's been since the bye week. Before the bye, he was around 50-60 snaps per game.

Same snap count as last several weeks, though. Also, welcome, B-Will! First game, and you've already out-snapped any game Stallworth got.

"Tue Dec 13 19:38:31 +0000 2022","3067061292","josephjefe","1602749827032354817","How good is your team at beating Vegas straight up?  

The Chiefs win 63% of their games when Vegas pregame odds are set between a 41-60% chance of winning (expectation would be around the middle of that range, so ~50%). 

NOTE: Pregame odds only! Not in-game.
