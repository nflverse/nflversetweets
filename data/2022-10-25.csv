Chubb and Jacobs the clear standouts, and its a massive shame about Breece Hall.

Data indicating that George Pickens does not have a lot of separation but certainly generates value when ball is in his hands. Similar to Freiermuth.

Only 22 personnel wasn't massively in the green. We passed 90% out of 11. That might be a season high? Moore still only getting snaps in 3 WR sets.

Oddly, given how effective they were early running the ball, they passed 73% of the time. Reminder: Dunlap is officially listed as a LB, so make the mental adjustments necessary.
