For whatever it's worth, here is how well (epa/play)  QBs performed this year when they suffered a hit, and when they did not.

Of the six QBs expected to start in those games, Derek Carr has fared the worst in the cold with a career EPA/play of -0.09 in games played with a temperature 50Â° or cooler.
