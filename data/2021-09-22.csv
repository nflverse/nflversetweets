The historical data suggests more predictive accuracy is coming, but we'll see how it plays out using @FiveThirtyEight and @LeeSharpeNFL prediction games! #nflverse https://t.co/Rud1PeQKsp"

Tried replicating a similar (and cool) plot by @benbbaldwin using {ggforce} to show team success against the run b/w '20 and '21. Small sample, but a noticeable drop-off for KC. #nflverse https://t.co/OXWwF4mVZL"

Notes:
• EPA/dropback plateaus at W4
• PFF grade has a higher plateau in W6
• EPA+CPOE Index overtakes EPA alone in W7

Patriots have run a conservative playbook with aDot below 6 yds. Nobody qb rookie has it since '13 with at least 50 att. Hope for Lawrence and Wilson that they will come back over the average for epa

-Tannehill
-Ryan
-Burrow 

And expect less from:
-Mahomes
-Garappolo
-Stafford
-Bridgewater
