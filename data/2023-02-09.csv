There is so much of this Mean Girls behavior from the more established football content creators it's ridiculous.

looking at play-by-play data, we can see how frequently and by how much the chiefs have been playing from behind this season...

KC offense vs CIN. 

We lost Toney on the second drive. Mecole and JuJu both injured on second drive of the third quarter. MVS took all but one snap after Hardman went out.

Gay left the game in the third, covered as usual by either Harris or Cook. Clark missed a handful of snaps to start the second, but then powered through basically the rest of the game. Mostly same for Jones.

Boyd went out middle of the second quarter. Looks like that was their only injury. Interestingly, they went 6 OL for a random 2nd and 1st down play late in the game.
