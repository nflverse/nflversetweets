How about your defense? Here's the EPA/play on blitzes split up into likelihood of a pass play. Number of total blitzes is under the EPA number.

My model has dropped them to under 6 wins and into the driver's seat for next year's first pick.  Dark days indeed.  My model is very bullish on @BuffaloBills with 1/3 sims ending with a SB win #nflverse https://t.co/XIpn04PIjZ"

For the game of the week, the model slightly favors @Chiefs at home over the @BuffaloBills, with KC winning 52% of the simulations #nflverse https://t.co/WZKmJjuqNw"
