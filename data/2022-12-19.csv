Jet got SO much more run than Pacheco this game. Watson remains Robinson 2.0. Moore with only two touches, both runs.

Only 3 total WR's for HOU is reflected in DB snap counts. Chenal got extra snaps for same reason, I assume. Gay only gave up one drive to Harris, and not even the entire drive! Progress?!

Basically, how often do they convert Red Zone chances into TDs?
