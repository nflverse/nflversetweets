"Tue Dec 20 16:28:59 +0000 2022","3067061292","josephjefe","1605238844986519559","Running backs. Pacheco lost some snaps due to that fumble of his in the 2nd quarter. That allowed Jet to continue to put distance between them. Jet has been top dog 5 of the last 6 weeks. Doubt that changes, though the split probably shifts closer to 50-50.

Williams snaps have fallen off a cliff last two weeks, though that's partly because we've run less 3 CB snaps. He and Watson are splitting snaps right now. Hopefully just to keep both sharp for the postseason.

"Tue Dec 20 16:29:01 +0000 2022","3067061292","josephjefe","1605238855916875782","Linebackers. Harris only took a partial series from Gay this week, though it was a long one. Chenal got more run, I assume because HOU was using a lot of heavy personnel. Bolton got all the snaps, as usual.

"Tue Dec 20 16:29:02 +0000 2022","3067061292","josephjefe","1605238859263930373","Interior Defensive Line, aka can anyone on the team not named Jones crack 50% of the snaps? The answer is nope, though Saunders has flirted with it. Jones's snaps have dropped the last two weeks. Wonder if they're trying to keep him fresh for playoffs.
