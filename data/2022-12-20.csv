That allowed Jet to continue to put distance between them. Jet has been top dog 5 of the last 6 weeks. Doubt that changes, though the split probably shifts closer to 50-50.

Williams snaps have fallen off a cliff last two weeks, though that's partly because we've run less 3 CB snaps. He and Watson are splitting snaps right now. Hopefully just to keep both sharp for the postseason.

"Tue Dec 20 16:29:02 +0000 2022","3067061292","josephjefe","1605238859263930373","Interior Defensive Line, aka can anyone on the team not named Jones crack 50% of the snaps? The answer is nope, though Saunders has flirted with it. Jones's snaps have dropped the last two weeks. Wonder if they're trying to keep him fresh for playoffs.
