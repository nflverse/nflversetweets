That allowed Jet to continue to put distance between them. Jet has been top dog 5 of the last 6 weeks. Doubt that changes, though the split probably shifts closer to 50-50.

Williams snaps have fallen off a cliff last two weeks, though that's partly because we've run less 3 CB snaps. He and Watson are splitting snaps right now. Hopefully just to keep both sharp for the postseason.
