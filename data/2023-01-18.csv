Nate Hobbs either got injured or was replaced. It's not like they've got good DB's, so probs an injury. Hope he's alright. I didn't get to see the game.

- Brady recorded the fastest time of his career this season! (W8 - 2.00s - #8 since 2016) 
- P.J.Walker recorder the fastest time overall since 2016! (W6 - 1.82s - #1)

KC starters needed to come out a couple drives before they did. Is Andy trying to make playoff opponents forget about JuJu? Toney's killing it in a limited role.
