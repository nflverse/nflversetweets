In PPR, #CeeDeeLamb is scoring almost 4 pts less per week than expected which has a 3.8% likelihood. #100daysofcodingchallenge #nflverse https://t.co/zmgq743Y9a"

Toney got 8 of 9 snaps on 1st or 2nd downs. Pacheco started again, then McKinnon took over. Skyy stayed involved the entire game, as did Justin Watson.

We were in base a lot, so didn't have a third CB on the field for those snaps. Williams played over Watson, though, when a 3rd CB was required. Wonder if that split will be matchup dependent.

Here’s KC’s 99(!!) offensive snaps, on a day we got 499 net yards of offense and it felt like we got 229 instead. As a note, Pats (magnificent) scrambles count as pass plays, since they were dropbacks, not designed scrambles.
