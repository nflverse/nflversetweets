Here’s KC’s 99(!!) offensive snaps, on a day we got 499 net yards of offense and it felt like we got 229 instead. As a note, Pats (magnificent) scrambles count as pass plays, since they were dropbacks, not designed scrambles.

If you think of years 1-4 like college, we've got 4 years of freshmen, 3 years of sophomores, 2 of juniors, and 1 senior class (2019 draft class).
